    "This exercise is inspired by [Finland being ranked the world's happiest country for the 6th year in a row](https://yle.fi/a/74-20023112). As the instructors of the Geo-Python course, we think we've found a better way to assess the individual happiness of people in Finland (particularly those taking this course!), and we're going to test our idea with you. In *five easy steps (or problems)* we'll be able to reveal your happiness based on two of life's most important happiness factors: Ice cream and sleep!\n",
